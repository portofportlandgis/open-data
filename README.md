## Open Data from Port of Portland GIS

# Data Disclaimer

Port of Portland geospatial data is gathered, maintained and primarily used for 
internal reference and analysis, and is only updated as resources permit. Geospatial 
data refers to data and information referenced to a location on the Earth's surface 
such as maps, charts, air photos, satellite images, cadastre and land and water 
surveys, in digital or hard copy form.

Geospatial data may be gathered and maintained by more than one person or department 
within the Port, and data distributed by one person or department may not reflect the 
most recent data available from the Port or from other sources. Port geospatial data 
is not intended for survey or engineering purposes or to describe the authoritative 
or precise location of boundaries, fixed human works, or the shape and contour of 
the earth.

The Port makes no warranty of any kind, expressed or implied, including any warranty 
of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or any other matter with 
respect to its geospatial data.

The Port is not responsible for possible errors, omissions, misuse, or 
misrepresentation of its geospatial data.

Port geospatial data is not intended as a final determination of such features as 
existing or proposed infrastructure, conservation areas, or the boundaries of 
regulated areas such as wetlands, all of which are subject to surveying or 
delineation and may change over time. No representation is made concerning the 
legal status of any apparent route of access identified in geospatial data.
